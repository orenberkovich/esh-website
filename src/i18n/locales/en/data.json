        "desc": "We are happy to announce that Clal, a reputable financial institution, with a history of successful investments in reliable and market-leading companies, is investing $30 million in esh, granting it ownership of 4.99% of the shares in each of the esh group companies - the bank and the technology company. Upon completion of the investment, the esh group companies will have a valuation of over $500 million. This investment will allow us to develop the product according to our vision and market entry. In a reality where economic transactions are performed automatically, and machine learning keeps developing and challenging traditional models, it demands a new bank operating-system that is most fitting. The unique platform developed by the technology company esh OS, is an alternative to the outdated core system used in banks today, and enables for the first time, a complete end-to-end banking services platform - all bank systems under one modular system. This is not only about a revolutionary technological change, but also a change in perception for all of us - from bankers to customers. Clal’s decision to join us on this journey is a vote of confidence from a leading institutional investor. We congratulate Clal on joining as shareholders in the group. Clal will join the existing shareholders, who have so far invested over $30 million. After the deal is completed, the total investment in esh will be over $60 million (Tier 1 equity capital). This is an opportunity to thank and congratulate our existing partners - experienced entrepreneurs and investors of exceptional international stature - from Nir Zuk and Alon Shine, who together with Alex Liverant and I form the control core, to Shmuel Gniwisch, Jose Mugrabi, and many others who are marching together with us.",
